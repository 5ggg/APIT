# Programming

## Compiling and running Java from the command line

- I will do this in class
- In simplest case, it involves two steps:
	- Compiling: `javac MyClass.java`
	- Running: `java MyClass`
- We will see some more complex examples throughout the course
- Feel free to use Eclipse if you prefer
- Also, Visual Studio Code...

----

## Organising projects

- All the programs in this course involve small numbers of classes
- For larger projects, it is important to organise all your files in a standard manner
	- Eclipse does this automatically
- If you want to do it manually, good description is available [here](http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/largejavaapps/)

----

## Classes

- Classes define objects
- `Pet` is a simple class used by `PetTest`
- Classes allow us to neatly combine related attributes and methods

----

## Inheritance

- One of the big strengths of OOP is *inheritance*
	- Creating classes that *inherit* everything of another class and add more
	- e.g. `Dog`, `Goldfish`, `PetInheritanceTest`
- In this example we also see `overridden` methods
	- `Dog` and `Goldfish` override the `description` method
	- The loop does not care which subclass the objects belong to.
	- This is very useful in many applications - *polymorphism*

----

## Abstract Classes

- Standard classes can be *instantiated*
	- i.e. we can create objects of their type (e.g. `Pet`, `Dog`, etc)
- Java allows you to define classes that cannot be instantiated: **Abstract classes**
- Abstract classes can only be sub-classed
	- e.g. `AbstractPet`, `Cat` and `AbstractPetTest`
- There is no situation where you would *have* to use an abstract class but many where it's neater
- Note that sub-classes have to implement all abstract methods or be abstract themselves

----

## Interfaces

- Interfaces are similar to abstract classes but:
	- Cannot have fields (unless they are `static` and `final`)
- See `InterfacePet`, `Parrot` and `TestInterfacePet`
- Interfaces are like contracts: they just specify the methods a class must implement
	- Note that methods in interfaces are abstract by default
- Note:
	- Classes can only sub-class one class...
	- ...but can implement many interfaces

# Some odds and ends

## `public`, `private` and `protected`

- Fields/attributes and methods are either public, private, or protected
	- Public: anything can access
	- Private: only objects of this type can access
		- e.g. `provideBone` method in `Dog`
	- Protected: only objects of this type, sub-classes (and other things within the same package)
		- e.g. `name` and `age` in `Pet` and `AbstractPet`
- In general, be as restrictive as possible.
 
----

## `static`

- Fields and methods can also be declared `static`
- This means that they are accessible without an object being instantiated
- Useful for storing generic methods and constants
- e.g. `MyMath` and `MyMathTest`
	- `areaOfCircle` is used without creating a `MyMath` object
	- Another static thing is used here - what is it?


----

## `static` attributes

 - Static attributes within an object are *shared* by all instances
 - Change the value in one, and it will change in all of the others...
 	- Useful, but not always the neatest solution

----


# Memory in Java

- Most data in Java is stored in Objects
- Objects are stored in an area of memory called the *heap*
	- There is one heap for the whole program
- Each thread has its own stack
	- All programs have at least one thread
	- In your programmes so far, there is one thread


----

## The Stack

- The stack is used for three purposes:
	- Evaluating expressions
	- Storage of local variables (variables in the current *scope*)
	- Management of method calls
- Think of it as a stack of paper.
	- Pieces of paper are put on (pushed), and taken off (popped), the top of the pile
	- LIFO: Last In First Out

----


## The Heap

- The heap is an area of memory used to store objects in Java
- Objects in the heap are accessible from any part of the program that has a local reference to the object
- Threads share a single heap
	- i.e. each thread can access objects in the heap
	- Useful, but causes all of the multi-threading problems we wil see
- In Java, objects are stored in the heap, references to objects are stored in the stack
	- This is very important, and we will come back to it later...

----

## Garbage collection

- Java periodically deletes objects when they are not needed
- An object is not needed if it is *unreachable*
	- i.e. no references to it exist

----

----

![Two more B objects and references created](Figures/garbage4.jpg)

----

![Reference b deleted](Figures/garbage5.jpg)

----

![Reference b2 deleted](Figures/garbage6.jpg)

----

![Objects with no reference are garbage. Note that the first B is still referenced from A so isn't garbage even though its original reference has been deleted](Figures/garbage7.jpg)

----

# Immutable objects

- Some native Java objects are *immutable*
- Once they are created they cannot be changed
	- e.g. String, Double, Float, Integer, etc
- It looks like we can change them?

~~~~{.java}
String a = "hello";
a+=" simon";
~~~~

- But, Java is creating a new object and storing the reference in `a`
	- Objects in heap, references in stack...
- See `StringExample`

----


# Call by value and call by reference

- Call by value
	- Value of a variable is passed to a method
	- Changes to the local copy are not reflected in the calling space
- Call by reference (e.g. C++)
	- Object references are passed to method
	- Actual object can be modified

- In Java, numbers and object references are call by value. Note that there is a difference between:
	- Objects are passed by reference
	- Object references are passed by value
- Objects passed to a method can be modified, but creating new ones will not be reflected in the calling scope (the reference cannot change)
	- `CallExamples`
- Objects are stored in the heap, references to objects are stored in the stack



----

![Example program](Figures/stringthing1.jpg)

----

![Main makes a String object and a reference (s)](Figures/stringthing2.jpg)

----

![stringTest makes its own reference to the String object (in)](Figures/stringthing3.jpg)

----

![String is an immutable type so when we change it, a new String is made](Figures/stringthing4.jpg)

----

![Back in main, s is still a reference to the original object. What happens to the "hello added" string when we return to main?](Figures/stringthing5.jpg)


----

## Final

- It is good practice to make as many things `final` as possible
- Make as many attributes `final` as possible
- Stops other people doing bad things to your code
	- `final` classes can not be sub-classed
	- `final` methods can not be overloaded
	- `final` variables cannot be modified once declared
- `final` is not the same as `immutable`
- `FinalTest` and `FinalTestFixed`


----

# Some useful Java objects

## ArrayList

- Java arrays are of fixed length
- `ArrayList` gives you an object that can handle arrays of any object that change length

~~~~{.java}
ArrayList<Integer> a = new ArrayList();
a.add(3);
a.add(5);
System.out.println(a.contains(4)); // Checks is 4 is in a
~~~~


----

## HashSet

- Useful way of keeping a set of objects together (not ordered)

~~~~{.java}
	HashSet<String> h = new HashSet<String>();
	h.add("hello");
	h.add("simon");
	h.add("hello"); // Wont add as already in there
	h.contains("hello"); // returns true
	h.remove("simon"); // removes this one
~~~~

- Very fast for checking if an item is in the set

----

## HashMap

- Useful way of storing key,value pairs

~~~~{.java}
	HashMap<String,Double> h = new HashMap<String,Double>();
	h.put("banana",3.0);
	h.put("apple",2.0);
	System.out.println(h.get("apple")); //print 2
	h.keySet(); // Returns a set of the keys
~~~~

- Very fast for obtaining items for a particular key

----

# Hashing

- Hashing solves the problem of *efficiently* finding items in some collection
- We'll use the example of storing a phonebook. E.g. we want to store the following:
	- Simon, 0777777777
 	- Jennifer, 0666677889
 	- Ravi, 056782776
 	- Ken, 0447838827
 	- Hannah, 066848382

----

- The simplest solution would be to create two arrays (forget the problem of parallel arrays for now)
- Then, to find the number for a particular person, we loop through the array of names
- `PhoneBook1.java`

----


- In general looping over all entries will be slow (if lots of entries)
- A solution:
	- Assume no name longer than 15 characters
	- Create two arrays as before
	- Store the name and number in the nth position, where n = length of the name
	- `PhoneBook2.java`


- This is much quicker as we can jump directly to the correct array position.
- It is a simple example of *hashing*
- In general, hashing is a way of mapping an object to a position in an array that enables finding it quickly
- A *hash function* is the function used to map from the object to the position
- In this example, the object is a `String` and the function simply computes its length

----

##Â Collisions

- What will happen if we have two names of the same length?
- A *collision*, and our simple program will fail
- Solution: maintain a list at each array position
- `PhoneBook3.java`


- Final problem is what to do if a name is longer than 15?
- Solution:
	- Fix the max length of array (e.g. 6)
	- Store entries in the position length % 6
	- `PhoneBook4.java`


- This is the basics of hashing
- Length isn't a great hash function
	- Want something that will spread the objects fairly evenly over the array

----

## `hashCode()`

- All objects have a `hashCode()` method
- Here's equivalent code to Java's `String` hashCode function:

~~~~{.java}
public int hashCode() {
  int hash = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < length(); i++) {
    hash = hash * 31 + charAt(i);
  }
  return hash;
}
~~~~

----

- You can overwrite `hashCode()` for your own objects
- By default the hashCode returns (roughly) the memory location of the object
- Note:
	- Two objects that are `equal` *must* have the same hash.
	- I.e. if `obj1.equals(obj2)` then `obj1.hashCode()` must equal `obj2.hashCode()` 
	- Why? Think about our hashing examples...

----

# Generics

##Â ArrayList

- What is the `<Double>` for in `ArrayList`?
- It is a `generic`
- i.e. `ArrayList` can work with any type (specified when you create it)
- You can make classes with generics too...

----

## Creating generic objects

~~~~{.java}
public class MyClass<T> {
	private T t;
	public MyClass(T t) {
		this.t = t;
	}
}
~~~~

- In the code above `T` can be any class
- Can also have multiple types in the definition (`<A,B,C,D>`)
- See `Dictionary.java`



# Testing

## Unit testing

- Testing individual components (e.g. classes, methods) to see if they are fit for use
- Design a suite of tests that can be run every time objects are changed
- Separates testing from the classes themselves

----

##Â JUnit

- `JUnit` is a popular Java unit test framework
- A *test class* is created for each normal class
- We can then run `JUnit` and it will automatically perform the tests
- Easiest to do this directly in Eclipse

----

## Assertions

- Unit testing is done at compile time
- We might also want *runtime* checks
	- to catch runtime errors (e.g. based on input that is unknown at compile time)
- The naive way is through the use of `if` statements

----

~~~~{.java}
public class AssertionExample {
	private int myInt;
	public AssertionExample(int n) {
		myInt = n;
	}
	public void decrement(int d) {
		if(d>myInt) {
			// Cannot decrement!
			System.out.println("Can't decrement!!");
		}else {
			myInt = myInt - d;
		}
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new AssertionExample(5).decrement(10);
	}
}
~~~~

----

- Assertions are a neater way to achieve this
	- Cause the program to exit if the condition is not met
	- Can be switched on or off at runtime
		- e.g. switch between runtime and debugging

~~~~{.java}
public class AssertionExample2 {
	private int myInt;
	public AssertionExample2(int n) {
		myInt = n;
	}
	public void decrement(int d) {
		assert myInt >= d;
		myInt = myInt - d;
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		new AssertionExample2(5).decrement(10);
	}
}
~~~~

----

- Running:

`java -enableassertions AssertionExample2`

- can also use `-ea`
- Try running with and without
- An alternative is to explicitly throw exceptions but..
	- Takes longer to write
	- Exceptions cannot be switched off at runtime (slows things down)

----

# JavaDoc

- It's very important to properly document your code
- Standard comments `//` `/*` are good
- Javadoc is better!
- [This]{http://agile.csc.ncsu.edu/SEMaterials/tutorials/javadoc/} is quite a good tutorial

----

# Things we are not covering here

## Testing

- We have only touched upon testing. It's very important! Those of you doing SE will cover it more there.
- Much software engineering is now done in a *test driven* manner.
	- First write test cases and then write code.
	- Stop coding when the test cases are finished.
	- Writing a good set of test cases is hard!

## Data structures

- We make use of Java objects (e.g. `ArrayList`) but we don't worry about how Java implements this
- We also don't worry too much about the efficiency of different data structures and algorithms
- Those of you in ADS will do lots of this

---

## Build systems

- Compiling from the command line is fine for simple projects
- But..when you have a more complex project with lots of *dependencies* things get very complex 
- Systems exist to help you with this
- Examples:
	- Maven (the current standard for Java)
	- ANT (older but still popular)
- See Tim Storer's ANT guide on Moodle


---

## Software Engineering

- Programming is only a small part of building software
- Engineering large software projects is hard (evidenced by the number of times they end badly)
- Youll get lots of SE in, erm, SE
